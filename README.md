# Running the React Project

This guide will walk you through the steps to extract and run a React project that is packaged as a zip file. The project is already included in the zip file, and you'll just need to perform a few commands to get it up and running.

- Node.js: You can download it from [here](https://nodejs.org/).

## Steps


1. **Extract the Zip File:**

   Extract the contents of the zip file to a directory of your choice using your preferred method (e.g., right-click and "Extract All" on Windows, or using terminal commands).

2. **Open Terminal:**

   Open a terminal window (Command Prompt on Windows, Terminal on macOS or Linux).

3. **Navigate to Project Directory:**

   Navigate to the directory where you extracted the contents of the zip file using the `cd` command. For example:

   ```sh
   cd path/to/project-directory

4. **Install Dependencies:**
    Run the following command to install the project's dependencies using npm:
    npm install
5. **Start the Project:**
    Once the dependencies are installed, start the project by running the following command:
